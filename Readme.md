## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (for running the app and managing dependencies)
- **Expo CLI** installed
- **Firebase Project** created in Firebase Console

---

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/themrsami/Expense-Tracker-Firebase-With-PDF-Report-Android-App.git
cd Expense-Tracker-Firebase-With-PDF-Report-Android-App
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Set up Firebase

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2. Enable **Email/Password Authentication**:
    - In the Firebase Console, go to `Authentication` -> `Sign-in method`.
    - Enable **Email/Password** authentication.
    - Optionally, enable **Email verification** to require users to verify their email addresses before they can log in.
3. Enable **Firestore Database**:
    - In the Firebase Console, go to `Firestore Database` and set up the database in "Test Mode" (or "Production Mode" if you're ready to set up security rules).
4. Download your Firebase configuration object (this will be used in the `firebaseconfig.ts` file).
5. Create a `firebaseconfig.ts` file in the root directory and add the Firebase configuration:

```typescript
// firebaseconfig.ts
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore"; // Import Firestore

// Your web app's Firebase configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-auth-domain",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-storage-bucket",
  messagingSenderId: "your-messaging-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id",
  measurementId: "your-measurement-id"
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const auth = getAuth(app);
const db = getFirestore(app); // Initialize Firestore

export { app, auth, db };
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual Firebase project credentials.

### Step 4: Configure Firebase Authentication

1. Enable **Email/Password Authentication** in the Firebase Console.
2. (Optional) Enable **Email Verification**:
   - In the Firebase Console, go to `Authentication` -> `Templates`.
   - Configure the **Email Verification** template if required.

### Step 5: Run the app

Once Firebase is set up and configured, run the app using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start a development server, and you can open the app in the Expo Go app on your mobile device or in an Android/iOS simulator.
